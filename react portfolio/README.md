# React  Portfolio

## Approach

This application was built using React, HTML, and CSS. Initially, the application was scaffolded using vite which created the backbone of the file structure. JSX was used to create the component and page files. Each page includes the Header and Footer components. The Navigation component uses <Link>'s to route the user to the various pages. On the Work page, the user is able to view and click images representing various projects I have completed while attending this bootcamp. There is also a contact page to send an email, and a resume page with a link to download my resume. The App.css file contains all styling for the application. 

## Credits

I referenced many of the activities in Module 20 during the creation of this application.
