        <p id="aboutMe">
          Hello, and welcome to my page! Let me tell you a little bit about myself. I graduated from the University of Tennessee with a Bachelor's degree
          in Marketing in 2009. Since then, I have held several jobs in the
          business space ranging from recruitment to healthcare management. In
          the spring of this year, I decided to make a change and harness a new
          skill within the web development community. In June, I began the full-stack web development bootcamp at Vanderbilt University. This course has enabled me
          to use my creativity and problem solving skills to develop attractive,
          functional web applications. Please have a look around my site to see
          some of my work!
