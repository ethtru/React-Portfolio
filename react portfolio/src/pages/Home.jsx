        <p>
          I graduated from the University of Tennessee with a Bachelor's degree
          in Marketing in 2009. Since then, I have held several jobs in the
          business space ranging from recruitment to healthcare management. In
          the spring of this year, I decided to make a change and harness a new
          skill within the web development community. This shift has allowed me
          to use my creativity and problem solving skills to develop attractive,
          functional web applications. Please have a look around my site to see
          some of my work!
